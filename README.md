# Typewriter
A little program that outputs text like it's being typed, written in rust.

## Building
You'll need a rust environment set up (https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html). 
Once you have everything installed simply run `cargo build` within the project directory.

## To-Do
* Make typing more realistic by adding varying delay lengths between outputs
* Allow the program to type out files from disk

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome, although this program is primarily intended to be a quick
project to help me become more familiar with rust.
